# 45 Minute Challenge

## Description:

The 45 minute challenge is simply a challenge to see how fleshed out of a webpage I can make in 45 minutes. The goal is not to make a fully functioning or even perfect webpage. It is just meant to be a fun challenge to see how much I can do in 45 minutes. I made this challenge to practice my HTML and CSS skills.

## What to do:

Simply create a webpage using vanilla CSS and HTML in 45 minutes. This included asset gathering. I do recommend using a CSS reset to make the styling a bit more consistent. I used the Digital Ocean minimal reset.

You can find it [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/css-minimal-css-reset).

## Result:

While I was able to make a VERY basic webpage, I got caught up in trying to add relevant content. Next time I will likely try and use generic filler content rather than trying to make it look like a real webpage.

As well, some of the styling (namely the footer) is not where it should be. Rather than being at the base of the page, it is at the end of the content. I will need to look into this more before next time.

I was able to bring some responsive elements into the design, but as there is very little on the page, it is not very noticeable. I will need to add more content to make this more apparent.

### Note:

- I do not recommend using a CSS framework like Bootstrap or a library like Tailwind as it will take away from the challenge.
- I also do not recommend using a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS as it will also take away from the challenge. The goal is to test your vanilla CSS and HTML skills.
