        <p>
          This website was created in 45 minutes as part of the 45 minute
          challenge. It is not meant to be fancy or useful. Simply just to put
          my ability to the test in building a simple website outline in a short
          period of time.

            This website was created in 45 minutes. No more, no less. If it is
            incomplete, that is the state it was in at the time-out.

          <p>
            There is really no purpose or functionality to this website. It
            simply exists as a challenge to see how quick I can create a page.
